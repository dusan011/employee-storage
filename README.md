This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Employee storage

The project was done using MERN Stack. For the database I choose MongoDB and the database is being hosted via MongoDB Atlas cloud platform.

Frontend: React, Bootstrap
Backend: NodeJS, Express and MongoDB

### `FRONTEND`

First, please clone it locally and enter "ebf-task" folder. Inside the folder you need to install all frontend dependencies that are being used in the project:

### `npm install`

Then you can start front end using command:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.<br />

For calling backend endpoints, I used axios library.

### `BACKEND`

Inside "ebf-task" folder, there is a folder called "backend". First install all backend dependencies:

### "npm install"

Then you can start backend using command:

### "nodemon server.js"

You need to run both frontend and backend to make sure that the project works successfully.
